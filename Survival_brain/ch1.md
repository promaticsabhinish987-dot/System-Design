Excellent topic — especially for a survival brain book.

If you're writing about the **survival brain**, patterns that resist change are central. The brain is wired for **predictability, familiarity, and energy efficiency** — not transformation.

Below is a comprehensive, structured list of patterns that resist change, grouped by biological, psychological, emotional, social, and identity levels.

---

# I. Biological & Neural Resistance Patterns

### 1. Homeostasis Preservation

The nervous system prefers internal stability over improvement.

### 2. Neural Pathway Dominance

Repeated thoughts/behaviors strengthen synaptic efficiency. Old circuits fire faster than new ones.

### 3. Energy Conservation Bias

The brain resists change because new behavior requires more glucose and effort.

### 4. Stress Avoidance Loop

Change = uncertainty = potential threat → amygdala activation.

### 5. Cortisol Familiarity

Chronic stress becomes chemically familiar; calm can feel unsafe.

### 6. Dopamine Habit Loops

Cue → behavior → reward cycles resist disruption.

### 7. Predictive Coding Lock-in

The brain filters reality to confirm existing models.

---

# II. Cognitive Resistance Patterns

### 8. Confirmation Bias

Seeking evidence that supports current beliefs.

### 9. Status Quo Bias

Preference for current conditions over alternatives.

### 10. Loss Aversion

Fear of losing outweighs desire to gain.

### 11. Cognitive Dissonance Avoidance

Rejecting information that threatens self-concept.

### 12. Identity-Protective Cognition

Beliefs defended because they support group identity.

### 13. Sunk Cost Fallacy

Continuing because time/effort already invested.

### 14. Learned Helplessness

Belief that change is pointless.

### 15. Fixed Mindset

Belief that abilities are static.

---

# III. Emotional Resistance Patterns

### 16. Fear of Uncertainty

Ambiguity activates threat detection.

### 17. Fear of Rejection

Social survival instinct blocks bold change.

### 18. Shame Avoidance

Avoiding growth to avoid exposure.

### 19. Comfort Zone Attachment

Emotional attachment to familiarity.

### 20. Emotional Memory Anchoring

Past pain dictates present avoidance.

### 21. Trauma Re-enactment

Repeating known emotional patterns.

### 22. Freeze Response

Inaction under perceived overwhelm.

---

# IV. Behavioral Resistance Patterns

### 23. Habitual Automation

Automatic routines override conscious intention.

### 24. Procrastination as Threat Avoidance

Delay reduces immediate anxiety.

### 25. Self-Sabotage

Maintaining identity coherence.

### 26. Perfectionism

Avoiding change until conditions are “safe.”

### 27. All-or-Nothing Thinking

Abandoning effort if imperfect.

### 28. Short-Term Reward Bias

Choosing immediate relief over long-term growth.

---

# V. Identity-Level Resistance Patterns

### 29. Narrative Rigidity

“I’m just not that type of person.”

### 30. Role Attachment

Clinging to familiar roles (victim, achiever, caretaker).

### 31. Ego Preservation

Protecting self-image over truth.

### 32. Tribal Loyalty Bias

Resisting ideas that threaten belonging.

### 33. Cultural Conditioning Lock-in

Inherited belief systems feel absolute.

### 34. Moral Certainty Bias

Equating change with betrayal of values.

---

# VI. Social & Systemic Resistance Patterns

### 35. Groupthink

Suppressing change to preserve harmony.

### 36. Authority Dependence

Waiting for permission.

### 37. Social Punishment Fear

Avoiding deviation to prevent criticism.

### 38. Institutional Inertia

Systems optimized for stability, not adaptation.

### 39. Power Structure Preservation

Those benefiting from status quo resist reform.

---

# VII. Survival Brain–Specific Patterns

### 40. Threat Amplification

Overestimating risk of new behavior.

### 41. Familiar Pain Preference

Choosing known discomfort over unknown possibility.

### 42. Hypervigilance

Scanning for danger blocks openness.

### 43. Emotional Hijacking

Amygdala overrides prefrontal cortex.

### 44. Scarcity Mindset

Perceiving change as resource threat.

### 45. Control Illusion

Maintaining routines to avoid unpredictability.

---

# VIII. Deep Evolutionary Patterns

### 46. Social Hierarchy Sensitivity

Avoiding change that risks status.

### 47. Exclusion Sensitivity

Belonging prioritized over growth.

### 48. Novelty Threat Bias

Unknown historically meant danger.

### 49. Conservatism Bias (Evolutionary)

Stability ensured tribe survival.

---

# IX. Existential Resistance

### 50. Fear of Identity Death

Major change feels like psychological annihilation.

### 51. Meaning Collapse Fear

If beliefs change, what anchors life?

### 52. Mortality Awareness Suppression

Avoiding deep transformation because it exposes vulnerability.

If you’re writing a book, this could become a powerful chapter titled:

**“52 Patterns That Keep the Survival Brain in Control”**

If you'd like, I can:

* Turn this into a chapter draft
* Reduce it into 10 core “master patterns”
* Create a visual framework model
* Or design a diagnostic self-assessment for readers

What direction do you want to develop this into?
